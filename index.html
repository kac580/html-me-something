  <h>In the beginning</h>
  <p>My migraines started late in life around the age of thirty-four with no known cause. At first, I would just get mild headaches 
    but after I guess a few years, the migraines kicked in. I started taking Excedrin Migraine medication like it was candy. And I 
    know you aren't supposed to take but one pill a day especially since they were the 24-hour dosage, but sometimes I would take two a 
    day. My head was pounding, I had to go to work, and I would do anything just to get relief. </p>
  <p id="p1">Every time I went to see my doctor, they would state that my blood pressure was high, and ask was I in any type of pain.  Of coarse 
    my answer was always that I had a migraine.  After several months of this, my doctor decided it was time to treat the high blood 
    pressure, because after all that was an issue (right?).  However, in doing this, the medication backfired.  See it lowered my blood 
    pressure to a point that when I stood up, I was so weak that I would fall.  Once I did a face plant onto the concrete sidewalk.  It 
    was then that she thought treating the bp was no longer an option and sent me to a neurologist.

    <h>Migraine Relief</h>
    <p>When I have a migraine, any type of light, especially fluorescent lights, is very hard to deal with. At work I don’t have many 
      options but have conned the maintenance department into taking the fluorescent lights out above my cube, even though this doesn't 
      sit well for the newest coworker that joined our group. He calls me the vampire lady.

   <p class="beginning"> 
      Ice packs or anything cold, is another good pain reliver.  Researchers believe that the cold reduces the inflammation in the brain 
      which improves the pain felt by the migraines. After dealing with migraines for a couple of years, I would agree with this 100%.

    <h>Professional Help</h>
    <p>Getting relief from the migraines did not come fast even after seeing a neurologist.  It took about a year to get the right medication
       down.  That regimen lasted for five years and now I’m back to the same battle.  I’m now with a new neurologist trying to find a new 
       solution as the migraines have shifted once again.  Thankfully there are newer meds on the market but at what costs?  I am now a 
       guinea pig for pain relief.  Right now the med is of no cost to me if I play nice with my insurance company, but if I don't I could pay
       up to $600 a month.  If it comes to me having to pay that cost, I will be forced to have to deal with the pain.</p>
